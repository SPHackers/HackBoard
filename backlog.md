## backlog

### Front-end
- Front-end initialization (webpack? backbone? reactjs? etc...)
- Initial templates (hierarchy)
- First page: Login form (w/ register link)
- Register form
- Dashboard view (logged in)
- List Task
- Add a Task
- Delete a Task
- Edit a Task

### Back-end
- Handle real login session (use JWT)
- Add logout feature
- Update to Laravel 5.3 (should be out next week)

### Other
- Brainstorm on any widgets or useful tool to put on the dashboard
- Brainstorm on any design. Bootstrap? Do we really need a design?

#####**Notes**:
- Keep things simple, we build a very simple feature and then later we'll improve its value.
- Remove a task from this list when completed/taken
